# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
# 
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
# 
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
# 
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
# 
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
# 
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
# 
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
# 
# m h  dom mon dow   command
45 8 * * * cd /home/ayesha/Desktop/Ayesha/CEW && gcc new.c -o p -lcurl cJSON/cJSON.c && ./p /home/ayesha/Desktop/Ayesha/CEW/logfile.log 2>&1

#after including header files
0 6,18 * * * cd /home/ayesha/Desktop/Ayesha/CEW && make -f Makefile &&./my_program /home/ayesha/Desktop/Ayesha/CEW/error.log 2>&1
0 6 * * 6 /home/ayesha/Desktop/Ayesha/CEW/WeatherReport.sh

#This command compiles only main.c into an executable named environmental_monitoring. The necessary declarations from weather.h are used, and the actual definitions from weather.c will be linked later during the final compilation process.
